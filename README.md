My bamazon node application allows customers to purchase items online. The bamazonCustomer.js file prompts the customer with a list of available items to purchase. The list gives the item_id as well as the price of the item. Once the user has chosen their specified item, bamazonCustomer has the customers order go through and provides them with a total cost of the purchase.

My bamazonManager node application prompts the user with a list of menu options. The user may either "View Products for sale", "View Low Inventory", "Add to Inventory", or "Add New Product".
